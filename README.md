# Bike-Sharing-Analysis-using-Regression-Techniques.

We divided our dataset into training set and testing set. The training set consist of first 19 days of the month while the testing set consist of the next 10 days. This was done to avoid overfitting. We want to predict the number of bikes per hour in the stations. For this reason, we are using regression techniques. We have started our prediction model using the most basic Linear Regression.
